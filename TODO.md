# TODO: Make Chat Messages Realtime

## Steps to Complete

- [x] Verify socket connection is established in AuthContext.jsx
- [x] Add debugging logs to confirm "newMessage" event reception in ChatContext.jsx
- [ ] Ensure selectedUser state matches senderId for message updates
- [ ] Test real-time message updates without refresh
- [ ] Fix any issues with socket event handling or state updates

## Current Status
- Socket.IO is installed and configured on both client and server
- Server emits "newMessage" events when messages are sent
- Client subscribes to "newMessage" events in ChatContext.jsx
- User reports needing to refresh to see new messages
- Added debugging logs to ChatContext.jsx for "newMessage" event

## Next Steps
- Add debugging logs to AuthContext.jsx for socket connection
- Ensure message state updates correctly on "newMessage" event
- Test the fix by sending messages between users
